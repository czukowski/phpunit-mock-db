Database Abstraction Layer mocking helpers for PHPUnit
======================================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/czukowski/phpunit-mock-db.svg?branch=phpunit-5)](https://travis-ci.org/czukowski/phpunit-mock-db)

A mock-object library for database queries testing, without having to initialize in-memory
database from fixtures. Rather, every query executed by a tested code can be set to return
a pre-defined result set, affected rows count or last insert ID. All with a familiar interface
similar to PHPUnit Mock Objects.

Installation
------------

```sh
composer require czukowski/phpunit-mock-db
```

Version numbering follows major PHPUnit version numbers, so for a given PHPUnit N.x, you'll get
the appropriate version of this package (this should happen automatically).

Usage
-----

Use `Cz\PHPUnit\MockDB\MockTrait` trait in a test case class, this will enable methods for
creating database mock instances. A 'fake' driver for a database abstraction layer used in the
tested code must be used, which implements both `Cz\PHPUnit\MockDB\DatabaseDriverInterface`
interface and that of the database abstraction layer's, additionally `getDatabaseDriver` method
must be implemented by the test case class, that returns an instance of that driver.

Note: This covers just the most simple and the most common use case for testing against a single
database connection, and the trait has been designed accordingly. If it is required to have multiple
database connections mocked at the same time or a different way to inject dependencies into the
tested code, a different implementation of `MockTrait` may be needed. But the trait is extremely
simple, especially in comparison to the 'fake' driver implementation that is needed anyway, you can
clone and adjust the trait for your project or come up with a completely different implementation.

### Examples:

Return a pre-defined result set on _any_ database query:

```php
$this->createDatabaseMock()
    ->expects($this->any())
    ->willReturnResultSet([
        ['id' => 1, 'name' => 'foo'],
        ['id' => 2, 'name' => 'bar'],
    ]);
```

Return a pre-defined result set on _any_ database query and expect it to be executed exactly once:

```php
$this->createDatabaseMock()
    ->expects($this->once())
    ->willReturnResultSet([
        ['id' => 1, 'name' => 'foo'],
        ['id' => 2, 'name' => 'bar'],
    ]);
```

Return a pre-defined result set on each specific database query, expecting each query to be executed
exactly once:

_Note_: the order in which the query expectations are being set up doesn't have to be same as the order
in which the queries will be executed.

_Also note_: the whitespaces will be ignored in query constraints, so they can be loaded from well-formatted
files, which could be especially useful for long and complex queries.

```php
$mock = $this->createDatabaseMock();
$mock->expects($this->once())
    ->query('SELECT * FROM `t1`')
    ->willReturnResultSet([['id' => 1, 'name' => 'foo']]);
$mock->expects($this->once())
    ->query('SELECT * FROM `t2`')
    ->willReturnResultSet([['id' => 2, 'name' => 'bar']]);
```

Expect mixed queries, some at specific invocations (note: SELECT query is set to return an empty
result set):

```php
$mock = $this->createDatabaseMock();
$mock->expects($this->at(1))
    ->query('INSERT INTO `t1` VALUES (1, "foo")')
    ->willSetLastInsertId(1);
$mock->expects($this->at(2))
    ->query('INSERT INTO `t1` VALUES (2, "bar")')
    ->willSetLastInsertId(2);
$mock->expects($this->once())
    ->query('SELECT * FROM `t1`')
    ->willReturnResultSet([]);
```

Expect same query executed exactly three times and return different last insert IDs on each
consecutive call, also note how this query is parametrized:

```php
$this->createDatabaseMock()
    ->expects($this->exactly(3))
    ->query('INSERT INTO `t1` VALUES (?, ?, ?)')
    ->with(['a', 'b', 'c'])
    ->willSetLastInsertId(1, 2, 3);
```

Return affected rows count:

```php
$this->createDatabaseMock()
    ->expects($this->exactly(2))
    ->query('UPDATE `t1` SET `foo` = "bar" WHERE `id` = 1')
    ->willSetAffectedRows(1);
```

Match SQL query using PHPUnit constraint (note: whitespace will not be ignored when using default
PHPUnit constraints):

```php
$this->createDatabaseMock()
    ->expects($this->once())
    ->query($this->stringStartsWith('SELECT'))
    ->willReturnResultSet([['id' => 1, 'name' => 'foo']]);
```

Set up different outcomes on consecutive calls for INSERT queries using a consecutive calls stub
builder:

```php
$this->createDatabaseMock()
    ->expects($this->exactly(4))
    ->query($this->stringStartsWith('INSERT'))
    ->onConsecutiveCalls()
    ->willSetLastInsertId(1)
    ->willSetLastInsertId(2)
    ->willThrowException(new RuntimeException('Deadlock'))
    ->willSetLastInsertId(3);
```

Set up custom callbacks to handle database queries (callbacks don't have to return anything):

```php
$mock = $this->createDatabaseMock();
$mock->expects($this->any())
    ->query($this->stringStartsWith('INSERT'))
    ->willInvokeCallback(function ($invocation) {
        $invocation->setLastInsertId(1);
    });
$mock->expects($this->any())
    ->query($this->stringStartsWith('UPDATE'))
    ->willInvokeCallback(function ($invocation) {
        $invocation->setAffectedRows(0);
    });
$mock->expects($this->any())
    ->query($this->stringStartsWith('SELECT'))
    ->willInvokeCallback(function ($invocation) {
        $invocation->setResultSet([]);
    });
```

By default, mock object is set to throw an exception if an unknown (unmatched) query is executed,
but this can be disabled:

```php
$mock = $this->createDatabaseMock();
$mock->setRequireMatch(FALSE);
```
